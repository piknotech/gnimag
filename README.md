_gnimag_ is an intelligent game auto-player. It is the _software_ component in this multi-part, real-time game autoplaying system:

- The smartphone runs a game, say _MrFlap_. It shares its screen with the computer.
- _gnimag_ is running on the computer. It continuously analyses the smartphone screen and calculates when exactly the robot should tap on the screen to try surviving as long as possible.
- Every tap that _gnimag_ schedules is performed by the tapping robot.

In this process, _gnimag_ considers every little detail. For example, there is a noticeable delay between the real-time game on the smartphone and the video stream that is received by the screen sharing program. There is a small additional delay involved between telling the robot to perform a tap and the tap actually being performed on the smartphone. _gnimag_ measures, and continuously updates, these delays and considers them when calculating the perfect moments for tapping.



_gnimag_ currently holds the **world record** in the following games:

- Todo.



If you've read this far and now want to try _gnimag_ for yourself: ***You do NOT need a robot in order to run _gnimag_**. If you own an Android device, the screen sharing program can simulate tapping your smartphone, so there is no need for a robot. You DO need a robot if you want to run _gnimag_ on an iPhone.

# Common

`Common` covers useful and common tasks that are too general to be contained in any other library. For example, you can:

- Create or subscribe to `Events` and `Promises`
- Use `Timing` to schedule tasks and cancel them before execution (or use `GCDTiming` for increased time precision)
- Use `Angle` for an intuitive interface into R/2Ï€R.

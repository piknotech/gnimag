# Geometry

Geometry contains some basic geometric tools that are used throught _gnimag_. Geometry bases on `CoreGraphic`, i.e. mainly uses `CGPoint` and `CGFloat`.

Geometry provides:

- Lines, rays and various shapes, like polygons and circles. These lines and shapes can be drawn by [`TestingTools`](../../Debug/TestingTools).
- Distance calculation from `CGPoint`s to any of the lines or shapes.
- `CGPoint` geometry: arithmetic operations, distance, length and rotation methods, dot and cross product, and conversion between cartesian and polar coordinates.

Here lives the Xcode project.

The project uses Swift 5.1; you need Xcode 11 for building and running gnimag.

All libraries are defined as targets. Dependencies are managed via [Accio](https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio). 

Call `accio update` to fetch dependencies. Then, you can select the `MacCLI` scheme in Xcode and run it.

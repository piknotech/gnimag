# identiti

identiti is a math game in which the player must solve as many math questions as possible.

As such, identiti is not a real-time game and does not require highly time-precise real-time tapping.

### Notice:
On Android, sometimes, long terms are erroneously spread over two lines and are unreadable, even for humans (without guessing). Then, an analysis or parsing error will be printed to the Terminal; the user must then decide where to tap.

This does not happen on iOS.

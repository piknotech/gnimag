## PyFlowSolver

`pyflowsolver` is a python script to solve Flow Free puzzles by reducing them to SAT and solving via `pycosat`. `pyflowsolver` was written by Matt Zucker. See his great article [here](https://mzucker.github.io/2016/09/02/eating-sat-flavored-crow.html). Code is open-source (from [GitHub](https://github.com/mzucker/flow_solver)).

We are not only using PyFlowSolver, but also c-flow-solver by Matt Zucker.

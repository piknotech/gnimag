/// This WayToSpecificPointStrategy performs a minimal required amount of jumps to ascend or descend to the required end height level.
/// The distance between all consecutive jumps is the same. This means, each jump contributes the same regarding height ascension or descension.
/// This is an optimal strategy in the following sense: it achieves the maximal possible minimum distance between two consecutive jumps by spacing out all jumps equally.

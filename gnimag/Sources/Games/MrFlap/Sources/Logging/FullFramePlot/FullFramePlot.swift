/// FullFramePlot is a time-height plot of the player.
/// To be precise, it shows actual detected time-height values of the player (i.e. the player's actual jumps) together with previously and future scheduled taps. This allows to compare previously scheduled taps to the actual resulting jumps.
/// In contrast to JumpSequencePlot it shows the current real time (from timeProvider).

# Geometry

Geometry contains simple geometric tools that are used throught gnimag. Geometry is built solely on a `CGFloat` & `CGPoint` basis.

Currently, these tools are:

- A set of simple Shapes and Lines, each with sensible methods like `contains(_ point: CGPoint) -> Bool` etc.
- `CGPoint` geometry: simple arithmetic operations, distance, length and rotation methods, dot and cross product, and conversion between cartesian and polar coordinates.
